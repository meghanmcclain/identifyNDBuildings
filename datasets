For my project, I have taken 20-30 photos using my iPhone of 3 buildings on campus at various angles and distances.
The buildings are the main building (dome), south dining hall, and duncan student center.

All of the photos were taken with cloudy skies in the background so it might be a little darker than if it had been sunny out. 
I tried to find three buildings on campus that did not have big objects (trees, tents, etc) in front of them that would block the building.

Moving forward, I will try to find a pre-trained model (perhaps VGG (Visual Geometry Group) or ResNet-18) and use its 
embeddings as features. These embeddings can then be classified (with the SVM (Support Vector Machines) classifier) and 
it's implemented in Python to tell which building is being shown. 

SVM is supervised learning used for classification.
